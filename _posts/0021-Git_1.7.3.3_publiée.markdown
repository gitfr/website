title: Git 1.7.3.3 publi√©e
---

C'est une version qui ne contient que des corrections de bugs (plus le backport `add.ignoreErrors`). Voici le changelog : 

* "git apply" segfaulted when a bogus input is fed to it.

* Running "git cherry-pick --ff" on a root commit segfaulted.

* "diff", "blame" and friends incorrectly applied textconv filters to
  symlinks.

* Highlighting of whitespace breakage in "diff" output was showing
  incorrect amount of whitespaces when blank-at-eol is set and the line
  consisted only of whitespaces and a TAB.

* "diff" was overly inefficient when trying to find the line to use for
  the function header (i.e. equivalent to --show-c-function of GNU diff).

* "git imap-send" depends on libcrypto but our build rule relied on the
  linker to implicitly link it via libssl, which was wrong.

* "git merge-file" can be called from within a subdirectory now.

* "git repack -f" expanded and recompressed non-delta objects in the
  existing pack, which was wasteful.  Use new "-F" option if you really
  want to (e.g. when changing the pack.compression level).

* "git rev-list --format="...%x00..." incorrectly chopped its output
  at NUL.

* "git send-email" did not correctly remove duplicate mail addresses from
  the Cc: header that appear on the To: header.

* The completion script (in contrib/completion) ignored lightweight tags
  in __git_ps1().

* "git-blame" mode (in contrib/emacs) didn't say (require 'format-spec)
  even though it depends on it; it didn't work with Emacs 22 or older
  unless Gnus is used.

* "git-p4" (in contrib/) did not correctly handle deleted files.
